# What the stuff of nightmares is this about?

well, its simple really: if you know, you know.

if you done, oh well, move on; there's life to live, and baloons to pop.

## The Quintessential Question?

do you want a carrot?

if yes, well, help make this website

if no, gtfo

## How to contribute?

1. fork the repo
2. add your work 
3. raise a PR

i promise to accept all "well mannered" PRs

## Now, the interesting questions

### 1. where does this website run?

this website is hosted on my laptop on the floor of my room

### 2. how is this website online? port forwarding and dynamic dns?

unfortunately, no

my ip is behing a CGNAT, so port forwarding won't work (yes, i tried ddns and everything possible to get this running)

so, the other option was to use a VPN, but i didn't want the visitors to connect to my VPN, plus i didn't wanna pay for any service - defeats the laptop on the floor, free hosting principle

enter, ngrok, a tunneling app that gives me random urls that can hit my local server from the public internet

the website is now reachable via [this link](https://bluegill-emerging-urchin.ngrok-free.app/)

> note: this link will change in future, so don't depend too much on this. message me for the updated link

## What next?

basically, make the website better, update the docs, and do some funky stuff
